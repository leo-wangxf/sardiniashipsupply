### 8 Apr 2016

**New version 5.0.0**

**Breaking with new features**

New features:
- Stores from same `TBase` share same `PBlobBs`. Speed improvements for 1000 empty stores:
  - create: 0.5s vs 21s
  - save: 0.6s vs 5s
  - load: 0.06s vs 4s
- Removed unused flags from blob pointer, freeing 37.5% space per `TBlobPt`
- Changed `TBlobPt` segment parameter from `uchar` to `uint16`, increasing max blob base size to **128TB**
- KMeans reimplemented in C++: Templated and wrapped Stopar's KMeans, which is implemented ```clustering.h``` and ```clustering.cpp```. The javascript wrapper contains the same functions as before.

Constructor parameters are:

name             | type    | description
-----------------|---------|---------------
**iter**         | number  | Number of iterations
**k**            | number  | Number of centroids
**verbose**      | boolean | If false, the console output is supressed
**centroidType** | string  | Type of the centroids. Options: "Dense" or "Sparse"
**distanceType** | string  | Distance type used at the calculation. Options: "Euclid" or "Cos"

**Properties**
```centroids```, ```medoids```, ```idxv```.

**Methods**
```getParams```, ```setParams```, ```getModel```, ```fit```, ```fitAsync```, ```predict```, ```transform```, ```permuteCentroids```, ```explain```, ```save```

The ```fit``` method can be used asynchronously (```fitAsync```).
```javascript
var qm = require('qminer');
var params = { iter: 10000, k: 2, verbose: false, distanceType: 'Euclid', centroidType: 'Dense' };
var kmeans = new qm.analytics.KMeans(params);
// create the matrix
var mat = new qm.la.Matrix({ rows: 1000, cols: 300, random: true });

//- Synchronous use of fit
kmeans.fit(mat);

//- Asynchronous use of fit
kmeans.fitAsync(mat, function (err) {
    if (err) { console.log(err); }
    // successful fitting
}); 

```

Bug fixes:
- fixed clang warnings
- changed tabs to four spaces on qminer source files
- Fixed issue 398 — move `stat.h` stuff to `xmath.h`
- Fixed issue 399 - stream aggregate example description


### 25 Mar 2016

**New version 4.10.0**

**Non-breaking with new features**

New features:
- `TStreamAggrOnAddFilter` class can be extended to override `CallOnAdd` method that takes a record and returns true if the aggregate should process it. Currently we have two filters: default that passes every record and `TOnAddSubsampler`, which can skip a given amount of records for every time the aggregate is actually updated. `TSimpleLinReg` is currently the only aggregate that supports filtering. Example:
```
var linReg = store.addStreamAggr({
    filter: { type: "subsamplingFilter", skip: 3 },
    type: 'simpleLinearRegression',
    inAggrX: winX.name,
    inAggrY: winY.name,
    storeX: "Function",
    storeY: "Function",
    quantiles: [0.25, 0.75]
});
```

Bug fixes:
- #394. Added asserts for invalid record IDs in the buffer which are a result of store window being too short (incompatible with the window aggregate).
- #264 (incorrect exception handling) `TJsonVal` has two new functions: `AssertObjKeyStr`, `AssertObjKeyNum`. The functions take a second parameter (function name), where `__FUNCTION__` can be used (not standard but works on msvc and gcc). 
Example: `ParamVal->AssertObjKeyStr("timestamp", __FUNCTION__);`
- #372. all JS vectors have `toArray` function.
- #350. arm publish script added

Other:
- deleted example tests (generated by travis)
- removed datasets tests (will be moved to `qminer-data-loader`)
- global mocha instalation is not required any more. tests can be run by calling `npm test`
- made tests in `store_partial_flush.js` silent 
- updated GitHub Wiki (part of #351)


### 18 Mar 2016

**New vesion 4.9.1**

**Non-breaking with a big fix**

Bug fix:

### 11 Mar 2016

**New version: 4.9.0**

**Non-breaking with new features**

New features:
- New aggregates:
  - `TWinBufFltV` (type: `timeSeriesWinBufVector`), connects to `timeSeriesWinBuf`, implements `IFltV` (holds a vector of buffer values in memory)
  - `TSimpleLinReg` (type: `simpleLinearRegression`), connects to two `IFltV` aggregates, computes a linear fit and (optionally) quantile bands

Bug fixes:
- `TGix::PartialFlush` had a bug when saved item set got assigned a new `TBlobPt`. Fixed #386

- async MDS segfault fix
- GUID method changed (can generate more than 10M IDs per second)

Other:
- Unit tests, documentation, examples: `timeSeriesWinBufVector`, `simpleLinearRegression`

### 5 Feb 2016

**New version: 4.5.0**

**Non-breaking with new features**

New features:
- Added support for default field-storage location for whole store. Add special tag `storage_location` in the `options` node of store schema. In the following example, Here, all fields of the store will be stored in cache as this is now the default for the whole store. Each individual field can still override this setting.

```
{
    "name": store_name,
    "fields": [
        { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
        { "name": "val", "type": "int" }
    ],
    "options": {
        "storage_location": "cache"
    }
}
```
- Added on `onTime(unit64 TmMsec)` and `onStep()` functions that enable updating of aggregates without adding a new record in the store. `onTime(unit64 TmMsec)` is added to the NodeJs interface, while `onStep()` is an internal function.

### 22 Jan 2016

**New version: 4.3.0**

**Non-breaking with new features**

Features:
- Location of join fields can be defined in schema (memory or cache).
- Nearest neighbor anomaly detector explain exposes first and last record ID
- Nearest neighbor anomaly detector accepts vector of rates (as opposed to only single rate). Predict returns position of the rate that is reached starting with 1 (or 0 if none).
- Can disable field name validation (`scrictNames` in base definition)
- TLinAlg can solve generalized eigenvalue problems
- added `TRecSet::TRecFilterByFieldUInt64`
- added `TIndex::HasJoin(const int& JoinKeyId, const uint64& RecId) const`
- added `THash::THash(const TVec<TKeyDat<TKey, TDat> >& KeyDatV)` constructor

### 15 Jan 2016

**New version: 4.2.0**

**Non-breaking with new features**

Features:
- Nearest neighbor init method exposed
- `TNodeJsFtrSpace` factory constructor added
- `IFtrSpace` interface added, implemented by `TWinBufFtrSpVec`, exposed in JS
- Field-join binary representation: Field-joins can now be stored in more compact way. Develop can specify field-types to be used for storing the field-join's record id and frequency by providing `storage` tag. Default is `uint64-int`. It is also possible to set frequency type to empty string, which means that frequency will be always 1 and it wont take any space in the storage. Example: `joins: [{ name: 'parent', type: 'field', store: 'People', storage: 'int16-byte' }]`
- `filterByField`: Recordset provides utility method `filterByField` that can now also operate on field joins: `recordset.filterByField("parent", parent_id, parent_id);`. It currently accepts record ids. Caller can provide a range of IDs (min and max).
- added tdigest stream aggregator for estimating any percentile from streaming data

Bug fixes:
- Sparse vector normalize fixed
- `TWinBufFtrSpVec` save/load fix
- `writeJson` and `readJson` do not parse and stringify in C++ but instead use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`
- added `readString` to `FIn` that complements `FOut.writeBinary`

Other:
- test stream aggregate `getFeatureSpace`
- `TWinBufFtrSpVec` save/load test

### 8 Jan 2016

**New version: 4.1.0**

**non-breaking with new features**

Features:
- Stream aggregate `TEmaSpVec` - exponential moving average for sparse vectors.

Bug fixes:
- `TNodeJsFuncStreamAggr` supports the `IsInit` method of the `TStreamAggr` interface provided by `init` function. Added unit tests.
- `TOnlineHistogram` supports additional init logic by specifying minimum count (when we have less than the given min, init is false).
- Code for new `int16` and `int64` types was copy-pasted in one place and not fixed.

Other:
- Added tests and documentation for Tokenizer and PCA

### 24 Dec 2015

**New version: 4.0.1**

**patch**

Bug fixes:
- Fixed reflexion of storage related objects (example: store.allRecords now reports to be a getter instead of a value). API was not changed. This fixes Tonic crashes.

### 18 Dec 2015

**New version: 4.0.0**

**breaking with new features**

Features:
- Now works with Node.js 4.x and 5.x
- (breaking) `QMiner` now supports the following new types:
  - `byte` - unsigned value between 0 and 255
  - `int16` - 16-bit integer
  - `uint16` - 16-bit unsigned integer
  - `uint` - 32-bit unsigned integer
  - `int64` - 64-bit integer
  - `sfloat` - single-precision float value (existing type `float` uses double precision)
  - `json` - arbitrary `javascript` object. Internally it will be stored as `JSON`. Automatically (de)serialized.
  - `blob` - binary buffer (uses `TMem` internally). When new record is created, this field needs to be sent in as base64-encoded string. When the record is accessed, the field is represented and can be manipulated as javascript's `Buffer` object.
- `TStreamAggrOut` two interfaces are now templated `IValTmIO` and `TValVec`
  - `TFltTmIO` is a typedef for `IValTmIO<TFlt>`
  - `TFltVec` is a typedef for `TValVec<TFlt>`
- `TWinBuf` is now templated (according to new templated interfaces) and an abstract class. A derived class must implement `TVal GetRecVal(const uint64& RecId)`. 
  - Two derived classes:
    - the old `TWinBuf` is implemented as `TWinBufFlt : public TWinBuf<TFlt>`
    - `TWinBufFtrSpVec : TWinBuf<TIntFltKdV>` takes a JSON array (or a single JSON) of feature extractor descriptors and computes sparse vectors of type TIntFltKdV on records
  — Added new interface functions to stream aggregate Node.js API 
- Added support for JSON argument inputs for: `extractVector`, `extractSparseVector`, `extractMatrix`, `updateRecord`, `updateRecords`. The methods that expected a record set can now take an array of JSON objects, where each object respects the store schema.
- Added sparse-vector sum aggregate for sparse vectors that maintains centroid vector of sparse vectors coming out of window buffer feature space aggregate.
- Introduced `qminer-data-loader` NPM module to handle datasets for examples.
- Node.js `TStore` implementation that let us wrap external data sources as stores. For now works with feature extractors
- Joins have index type by default.

Bug fixes:
- MDS documentation fixed.

Other:
- Added recordSet.sortByFq to documentation
- Added examples to linear algebra
- Updated travis and appveyor to test: arch x64/x86 - node 0.12/4/5 - platform win/linux/osx
- Made qm structures safe for Tonic notebooks (no crashing due to infinite recursion)
